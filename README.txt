****Jack The Course Decision AI****
Author:  Kyle Siler
Version:  1.0

When the program is run, Jack will ask the user a series of questions that will help the user find their best suited area of study based on their intrests
and the responses they have provided to the questions.

*Jack can currently recommend 11 different majors based on 5 interest paths.
*If the user is not satisfied with the suggestion the AI has made, then the AI will switch to a different path.  If an area of study could not be found based
 on the user's interests, then the AI must consider any new interests the user has.
*The AI utilizes a java database to store all of the different majors and interests possible for the user.
*When the AI informs the user of their best suited area of study, they will be taken to a new screen with information on the field.  When they click "ok", they will be
 taken to the Bureau of Labor Statistics web site using the computer's default browser so the user can understand the salary, duties, descriptions, and etc. of the field/area of study.
*AI decision stages:
	1) User Interests (Initial Questioning Stage)
	2) Path of Major (Distinguishing majors from database stage)
	3) Confirmation (Final decision/re-evaluation stage)
	4) Major Decided (Final Output Stage)
